This is a game a made for my "matura" project

The game is made with Python and Pygame without a GameEngine and all the textures are crated by me.

In this 2d platformer game the player can turn into multiple different objects like a sword or a spiky 
ball that can climb the walls. The goal for the player is to reach the finish.
